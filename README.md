# Statistical-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning
This was a project for the second year in FCIS ASU, this project demonstrates the practical work that can be done through statistical analysis.
This project is made with Jupyter Notebooks.
This research was conducted to discover the relation between physical fitness and academic performance and achievements, 
and whether they are related or not. And what type of correlation they have in case it exists
First the data is analyised using python data analysis libraries like numpy and pandas.
The data is then visualised using matplotlib and seaborn
Statistical outliers are removed from the data (data cleaned) to ensure clear results.
Correlation and regression among the data is determined using a heatmap and a cross dot plot across all data coloumns.
Finally a simply linear regression machine learning model is made.
the model is not successful because the data is very weakly correlated.
